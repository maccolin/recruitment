## Become a Contributor
To become a contributor, all you need to do is submit pull request. For those new to GitHub and Git workflow, read this quick set of steps:

1. Find something you want to and can do
  - Look through the [open issues](https://github.com/maccolin/recruitment/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue)
  - Find something in the [next milestone](https://github.com/maccolin/recruitment/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open)
  - See a feature you think is missing, choose to add THAT :octocat:
2. Fork the repo. This will make a new copy on your personal GitHub account that you can pull and edit as much as you like.
3. Clone onto your computer
4. make changes in master or another branch as you see fit.
5. push changes back to your personal GitHub repo
6. make a pull request on this repo referencing your changes and describe what you changed and what it solves.
7. if the changes fix a problem in an issue or milestone, comment on the issue thread that your pull request fixes that issue.

I know we will have a great time working together! :+1
